\textbf{Use Case U2:  Save Timed Events}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Timer\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }N/A\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }Use Case 1 Scenario 2:
\textit{Stop the Timing}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders and Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Wants to archive the given timed event.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Timer stopped at some previous
point by the User.\\
\textbf{Success Guaranties:  (Postconditions)} 
The Timer archives the Timing data, including all the laps and 
total elapsed time to the location and name specified by the User.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Indicates to save the current timed data. & \\\hline
&2.  Requests where to save the data and file name.\\\hline
3.  Inputs file name and location for archiving. &\\\hline
&4.  Saves the total elapsed time, and all the elapsed times in the
location specified by the User.\\\hline
&5.  Saves the date in millisecond resolution.\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }\\
4a.  If the System is unable to archive the data, then the System will
indicate the error to the User.\\
4b.  If the record does not exist, then the System will create the
file and archive the data.\\
4c.  If the record does exist, then the System will archive the new
timing data by appending it to the record.\\\\
\textbf{Technology and Variations List:  }\\
4d.  As the technology changes, the System is to be able to handle
different types of archiving formats and methods.\\\\
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Almost continuously--as many
times the User desires to record an elapsed time event.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item Perhaps just print out the record?
\end{itemize}

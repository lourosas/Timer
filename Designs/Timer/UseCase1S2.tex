\textbf{Use Case U1S2:  Time Events}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Timer\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Stop Timing\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }Use Case 1 Scenario 1:
\textit{Start the Timing},
\\Use Case 2:  \textit{Save the Timed Events}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders and Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Wants to measure the elapsed time of an event.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Timer was started at some previous
point by the User.\\
\textbf{Success Guaranties:  (Postconditions)} 
The Timer stops and indicates the elapsed time to the User.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Indicates to stop timing. & \\\hline
&2.  Stops Timing.\\\hline
&3.  Calculates the final elapsed time.\\\hline
&4.  Displays the elapsed time in millisseconds resolution.\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }\\
*a.  If at any time, the System cannot measure the time for the
elapsed time, then the System informs the User the Timer has
stopped working properly.\\\\
\textbf{Technology and Variations List:  }\\
2b-4b.  The Actuall accuracy of the timer is dependant and
will vary based on the task schedulers of both the Operating
System and the language used for implementation.\\\\
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Multiple timers as needed.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the accuracy dependant on the Operating System?
\item Is the accuracy dependant on the Hardware?
\item How does language affect the accuracy of the Timer?
\item How does a ``fully loaded System" affect the accuracy
of the Timer?
\end{itemize}

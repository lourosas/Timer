\textbf{Use Case U1S1:  Time Events}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Timer\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Start Timing\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }N/A\\
\textbf{Stakeholders and Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Wants accurate timing
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Timer is running, not timing (the
is stopped or paused).\\
\textbf{Success Guaranties:  (Postconditions)} 
The Timer is started, and accurately timing the event.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Indicates to start timing. & \\\hline
&2.  Records the Start time.\\\hline
&3.  Calculates the elapsed time.\\\hline
&4.  Displays the elapsed time in seconds resolution.\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }\\
*a.  If at any time, the System cannot measure the time for the
elapsed time, then the System informs the User the Timer has
stopped working properly.\\\\
\textbf{Technology and Variations List:  }\\
2b-4b.  The Actuall accuracy of the timer is dependant and
will vary based on the task schdulers of both the Operating
System and the language used for implementation.\\\\
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Multiple timers as needed.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the accuracy dependant on the Operating System?
\item Is the accuracy dependant on the Hardware?
\item Multitasking issues?
\item Multithreading issus?
\item How does language affect the accuracy of the Timer?
\item How does a ``fully loaded System" affect the accuracy
of the Timer?
\end{itemize}

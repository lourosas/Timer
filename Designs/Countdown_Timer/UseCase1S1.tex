\textbf{Use Case U1S1:  Manage Countdown Time Events}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Timer\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Start the Countdown Timer\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }N/A\\
\textbf{Stakeholders and Interests:}
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Wants an accurate countdown time
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Countdown Timer is up, a time is entered,
(See \emph{Use Case 1S4: User Enters the Countdown Time}), the Countdown Timer
is currently not running.\\
\textbf{Success Guaranties:  (Postconditions)} 
The Countdown Timer is running, and accurately counting down the time
(to 0 seconds).\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario: }\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Indicates to start the timing countdown. & \\\hline
&2.  Records the Countdown time (See \textit{Use Case 1S4:  User Enters the 
Countdown Time}).\\\hline
&3.  Subtracts (Counts Down) the time in one-second increments.\\\hline
&4.  Displays the new time (currenttime = previous time-1sec).\\\hline
&5. Repeats 3 \& 4 until the currenttime is 0\\\hline
&6. Alerts the User the countdown is complete\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Alternative Flows:  }\\
*a.  If at any time, the System cannot measure the one second increment
for the countdown, then the System informs the User the Countdown Timer
has stopped working properly.\\\\
\textbf{Technology and Variations List:  }\\
2b-6b.  The Actual accuracy of the timer is dependant and
will vary based on the task schdulers of both the Operating
System and the language used for implementation.\\\\
\textbf{Frequency of Occurrence:  }Multiple Countdown Timers as
needed.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the accuracy dependant on the Operating System?
\item Is the accuracy dependant on the Hardware?
\item Multitasking issues?
\item Multithreading issues?
\item How does language affect the accuracy of the Countdown Timer?
\item How does a ``fully loaded System" affect the accuracy
of the Countdown Timer?
\end{itemize}
